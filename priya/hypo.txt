Greater than (>) alternative hypothesis: This is used when you want to determine if there is evidence of a positive or increased effect. You would choose this option if you have a specific expectation that the parameter or effect you are investigating is larger than a particular value. For example, if you are testing a new treatment, you might formulate your alternative hypothesis as "The mean improvement in symptom severity for the treatment group is greater than the mean improvement for the control group."

Less than (<) alternative hypothesis: This is used when you want to determine if there is evidence of a negative or decreased effect. You would choose this option if you have a specific expectation that the parameter or effect you are investigating is smaller than a particular value. For example, if you are comparing two groups, you might formulate your alternative hypothesis as "The mean response time for Group B is less than the mean response time for Group A."

Not equal to (â‰ ) alternative hypothesis: This is used when you want to determine if there is evidence of any significant difference, regardless of the direction. You would choose this option if you are interested in determining if there is evidence of a significant effect, either positive or negative. For example, if you are comparing two populations, you might formulate your alternative hypothesis as "The mean income of Population A is not equal to the mean income of Population B."
